# EggHeads

## Project Description

EggHeads is an application that allows users to select a randomly generated egg with various attributes (size, color, etc.), and leave it in their personal incubator until it's ready to hatch into a pet. Once hatched, the user will find out what animal was in the egg, and be granted a short randomized description. All of their hatched pets and incubating eggs can been accessed from the user's homepage.
