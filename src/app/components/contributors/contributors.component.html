              Anakin is a Java software engineer with experience in developing both the frontend and backend
              of a web application. He went to school at the University of Central Florida where he completed
              his Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology. He got interested in programming from
              some of his college courses and found it fascinating to be able to develop applications, rather
              it is the user interface of the application or the business logic behind a button when you
              press it and interact with the backend.
